            <h1>Eulogy of Nicolus</h1>
            <p>Gentlemen of the jury—</p>
            <p>The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter whom he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he may lose. It flies from him perhaps when he needs it most. A man’s reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is Nicolus.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Joseph, Nicolus stands by a man in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his friend's side. He will offer his hand when there is no food to offer, he will help in ways no one else can, and endure the roughness of the world’s trials. He guards the sleep of his friend as if they were royalty.</p>
            <p>When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens. If fortune drives the man forth an outcast into the world, friendless and homeless, Nicolus asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to protect him from danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his friend in its embrace and his body is laid in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will Nicolus be found, his head bowed in solemn respect, his eyes filled with quiet sorrow but unblinking, ever vigilant, faithful and true, even unto death.</p>
